# Alby_API_Lib
A Rust library for the Alby API.
The library provides some simple abstractions for the Alby API, with functions for the routes and structs for the request and return types.

# Currently Implemented
* Refreshing a Token (https://api.getalby.com/oauth/token)
* Creating Invoices (https://api.getalby.com/invoices)
* Retrieving Value 4 Value Data (https://api.getalby.com/user/value4value)

# TODO
All routes but the ones mentioned above still have to be implemented
